          <p>Hey, what's up <script type="text/javascript">document.write(userName);</script>! I'm Danny and here's some stuff about me!
      <br>I live with my best friend, her 3 dogs, 2 cats, and also my dog and 2 cats. 8 pets total in one little townhouse. You'll probably meet my dog Gansey at some point, I try to bring him on Mondays. My two cats are named Bogey and Ronan, ages 18 and 2 respectively. I named Gansey and Ronan for two characters from my favorite book series, <a href="http://www.maggiestiefvater.com/the-raven-boys/">The Raven Cycle</a> by <a href="http://www.maggiestiefvater.com/">Maggie Stiefvater</a>. Here's some pictures of them!</p></div>

      <br><div id="ghostbox"><p>A little more about me; I'm 24 years old, I speak conversational German, Spanish, and ASL. I wouldn't say I'm fluent but I'm working on it. I used to know Japanese but I've forgotten it since high school. In my spare time, I still study and practice those 3 languages, but I think I've given up on Japanese. Oh! I've also been studying Esperantu when I'm not practicing the other 3, since it's a kind of universal language and I could use it while traveling if I don't speak any native languages! It's super cool and it's an "invented" language, so I'm really interested in it.</p></div>

      <div id="ghostbox"><p>So my experience in coding is very minimal. I took Web Design 101 in high school, for one term since I was dropping a tyrannical Journalism class. It had already been 3 weeks since the classes had started, so I was behind on everything. My teacher, Mr. Guthrie, was super nice and told me that I could catch up on all the assignments I missed during the free hour. By the end of my first class, I had caught up and gone ahead of everyone else. It just seemed to click with me, but I didn't think it was something that was going to be a sustainable career, and besides, I wanted to be a vet anyway.

      <br>Well, after 2 years of college and a couple of shadowing opportunites, I decided veterinary medicine wasn't for me. So I skipped out on school altogether for about 5 years, instead just jumping around a few different jobs. I've been a barista for about 5 or 6 years, going from Starbucks to a local coffee shop, Floyds Coffee. I actually met quite a few people from Code Fellows from my time working at Floyds on the corner of Salmon and 3rd, when the Lotus was still operational and Code Fellows was in the building a few doors down. It was what got me thinking about Alchemy Code Lab as a thing I wanted to persue.</p></div>
